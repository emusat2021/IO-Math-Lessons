1st milestone project: User-Centric Frontend Development - [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) assignment project.

This is an non profit organisation "IO Math Lessons" who provides websites with math lessons.
The math lessons are intended to be used for pupils in secondary school (5th to 9th grade) in order to help them learn a math lesson more easily.
 
Pythagora's theorem is the first lesson offered by **_IO Math Lessons_**.

The lesson is presenting Pythagora's theorem as well as images for better understanding, video and exercises.

This website gives the opportunity to contact IO Math Lessons and it is providing a form to send messages with a posible lesson request.

## Design

The goal in design was to create a website for a math lesson that is overall user friendly. 
The pupil will easily understand the info presented.
The pupil will practice with excercises.
The color of the backgroud, video, images will capture the pupil's attention to the lesson and make the lesson more interesting.

### Description page
Description is the *first page* of **Pythagora's theorem**. 
The following pieces of information are on this page:
* A basic presentation of Pythagora's theorem;
* Pythagora's picture;
* Formula for the theorem;
* A colorful image that presents the formula in a more pleasant way for the pupil.

### Lesson and Exercises page
Lesson and Exercises is the *second page* of **Pythagora's theorem**.
The following pieces of information are on this page:
* A lesson in which the theorem is presented with an example of how to calculate a triangle's side using the theorem.
* A video where another exemple is presented in order for pupil to understand the theorem.
* A suggestive image that presents the formula for the pupil.
* A test with three exercises where the pupil can test the knowledge of the theorem.
* Possibility for the pupil to fill in an answer calculated by him/herself.
* Possibility for the pupil to choose the correct answer.
* A suggestive image with the purpose of helping to better calculate the formula for the exercises.

### About us page 
The following pieces of information are on this page:
* Who are we?
* What do we currently offer?
* Contact details with address and telephone number.
* A form for users to suggest other lessons that they might want.

## Features Left to Implement

* One of the improvments that can be done is to provide a submit button for the "Exercises" page and use JavaScript to auto-grade the test.
* Another feature that I would like to implement back-end for contact and sign-up form to make them fully functional.

 
# Technologies Used

## Languages Used

### HTML
All the HTML files were tested through [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input). No errors were found across the html pages.
### CSS
CSS files were tested through [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). No errors were found across the css file.

I used [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) online tool for checking responsiveness on different devices.

# Deployment

GitHub Pages
The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps:

1. Logged in to GitHub and located the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/emusat2021/Lesson---Pythagoras-Theorem)
2. At the top of the Repository, located the "Settings" Button on the menu.
3. Scrolled down the Settings page until "GitHub Pages" Section was located.
3. Under "Source", clicked the dropdown called "None" and selected "Master Branch".
4. The page automatically refreshed.
5. Scrolled back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://emusat2021.github.io/Lesson---Pythagoras-Theorem/) in the "GitHub Pages" section.
